# Earthquake Data Visualization

## Purpose

An earthquake data visualization webpage providing interactive features for visitors was created using a combination of different programming tools and languages.

Javascript, D3 and Leaflet library were utilized to retrieve earthquake data. Mapbox, CSS and HTML code were used to format the webpage and plot the retrieved data onto a map, reflecting both location and magnitude as well as relations on fault lines/tectonic plates.
